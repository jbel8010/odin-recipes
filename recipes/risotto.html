    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mushroom risotto is a classic Italian dish that combines arborio rice with sautéed mushrooms, onions, and garlic, and is cooked slowly with wine and broth until the rice is tender and creamy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté until they release their moisture and start to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, add the onion and garlic and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the arborio rice and stir to coat it with the onion mixture. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the rice becomes slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the white wine and stir constantly until the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next. Cook for 20-25 minutes or until the rice is tender and the mixture is creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the sautéed mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and cook for another 2-3 minutes until everything is heated through.        </li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley if desired. Enjoy your delicious mushroom risotto!</li>
